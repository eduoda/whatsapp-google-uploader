  path: fc.string({ minLength: 1, maxLength: 260 }),
  size: fc.integer({ min: 0, max: 5 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024 }),
  type: fc.constantFrom('photo', 'video', 'document', 'audio'),
  hash: fc.string({ minLength: 64, maxLength: 64 })
    .filter(s => /^[a-f0-9]+$/.test(s)),
  // ... comprehensive metadata structure
});
```

### Testing Challenges & Solutions

#### Challenge: Google API Dependencies
**Solution:** Comprehensive mock system with realistic failure modes and response patterns
```typescript
// Configurable API mock with realistic behaviors
mockGoogleDrive.configure({
  shouldFail: false,
  rateLimitAfter: 100,
  responseDelay: 50,
  quotaExceeded: false
});
```

#### Challenge: Async Operation Testing
**Solution:** Structured async/await testing patterns with proper error handling
```typescript
// Proper async test structure
it('should handle concurrent uploads', async () => {
  const uploads = Array(10).fill(null).map(() => 
    uploadManager.upload(createMockFile())
  );
  
  const results = await Promise.allSettled(uploads);
  
  expect(results.every(r => r.status === 'fulfilled')).toBe(true);
});
```

#### Challenge: Performance Test Reliability
**Solution:** Statistical analysis and performance regression detection
```typescript
// Performance test with statistical validation
it('should maintain consistent upload performance', async () => {
  const measurements = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    const start = performance.now();
    await uploadManager.upload(standardTestFile);
    measurements.push(performance.now() - start);
  }
  
  const average = measurements.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / measurements.length;
  const variance = measurements.reduce((sum, x) => sum + Math.pow(x - average, 2), 0) / measurements.length;
  
  expect(average).toBeLessThan(5000); // 5s max average
  expect(variance).toBeLessThan(1000); // Low variance for consistency
});
```
