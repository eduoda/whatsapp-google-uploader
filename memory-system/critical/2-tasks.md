## [ ] dwarf - TASK-006 - Proxy Library Development (Core Orchestrator) **REOPENED - 20% COMPLETE**
- Priority: 1
- Description: Complete implementation of main orchestrator library with actual upload integration, content-based file hashing, rate limiting enforcement, retry logic, smart file routing (photos‚ÜíGoogle Photos, docs‚ÜíDrive), concurrent upload management, and resume capability
- Depends on: TASK-002, TASK-003, TASK-004, TASK-005
- Phase: Phase 2 - Core Features
- **Status**: REOPENED - Only basic structure and Google Sheets integration completed
- **Completion**: ~20% (structure + sheets integration only)
- Branch: TASK-006-dwarf

**MISSING IMPLEMENTATION** (Critical - 80% remaining):
1. **Real upload integration**: Connect to Google Drive/Photos libraries (currently TODO on line 74)
2. **Actual file hashing**: Hash file content, not just filepath (broken implementation on line 135)
3. **Rate limiting enforcement**: Use the rate limit config that exists but isn't applied
4. **Retry logic & error handling**: Exponential backoff, permanent vs transient error classification
5. **Smart file routing**: Route photos/videos ‚Üí Google Photos, documents/audio ‚Üí Google Drive
6. **Concurrent upload management**: Replace sequential loop with concurrent processing
7. **Resume capability**: Handle partial uploads and recovery from failures

**ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**:
- [ ] Actual file uploads working (not placeholder TODO)
- [ ] Content-based SHA-256 hashing (read file bytes, not path)
- [ ] Rate limiting actively enforced (respect maxConcurrent, requestsPerSecond)
- [ ] Exponential backoff retry logic for transient failures
- [ ] Smart routing: photos/videos ‚Üí Google Photos, documents ‚Üí Google Drive
- [ ] Concurrent uploads with configurable limits
- [ ] Resume failed uploads on restart
- [ ] All integration tests passing with real upload flows

## [‚ùå] database - TASK-012 - Google Sheets Database Enhancement **CANCELLED**
- Priority: 2  
- Description: ~~Enhance the sheets-database package with advanced features like batch operations, error handling, retry logic, and performance optimization~~
- Depends on: TASK-006 (Proxy library completed with basic sheets integration)
- Phase: Phase 2 - Core Features
- **CANCELLED REASON**: Over-engineering for personal WhatsApp backup use case. Current Google Sheets implementation is perfectly adequate for hundreds to thousands of files. Google Sheets API limits (100 req/sec) are more than sufficient. Following YAGNI principle - simple solution works well for intended use case.
- **DECISION**: Focus on delivering user-facing CLI features instead of premature optimization

## [‚úì] gnome - TASK-013 - Package Consolidation and Structure Simplification **COMPLETED & MERGED**
- Priority: 1
- Description: Consolidate 6 packages into single-package structure, remove Lerna/workspaces, create simplified build system
- Depends on: Current project analysis
- Phase: Phase 1 - IMMEDIATE CONSOLIDATION
- Started: 2025-09-13 10:30
- Worktree: TASK-013-gnome
- Branch: TASK-013-gnome
- Conflicts: None (first critical step in simplification)
- Planning: TASK-013-gnome-planning.md
- Completed: 2025-09-13 14:30
- Report: TASK-013-gnome-report.md
- **MERGED**: 2025-09-13 15:45 by architect - Successfully merged to main, all functionality verified

## [üîÑ] dwarf - TASK-014 - Code Merging and API Simplification **IN PROGRESS**
- Priority: 1
- Description: Merge Google Drive, Photos, and OAuth into single GoogleApis class, simplify token management, consolidate type definitions
- Depends on: TASK-013 (Package consolidation completed - ‚úÖ READY)
- Phase: Phase 2 - CODE SIMPLIFICATION
- Started: 2025-09-13 17:30
- Worktree: TASK-014-dwarf
- Branch: TASK-014-dwarf
- Conflicts: None (TASK-013 dependency resolved)
- Planning: TASK-014-dwarf-planning.md

## [ ] dwarf - TASK-015 - Complete Proxy Implementation (Finish TASK-006)
- Priority: 1
- Description: Complete the 80% missing from TASK-006 - implement actual file uploads, proper error handling, integration with all components
- Depends on: TASK-014 (API simplification completed)
- Phase: Phase 3 - COMPLETE PROXY IMPLEMENTATION

## [ ] api - TASK-007 - CLI Application Development  
- Priority: 2
- Description: Implement complete CLI interface with all commands (scan, upload, setup, check, logs)
- Depends on: TASK-015 (Proxy library truly completed)
- Phase: Phase 4 - CLI & UX (moved up from Phase 4 due to TASK-012 cancellation)

## [‚ùå] architect - TASK-011 - SQLite3 to better-sqlite3 Migration **OBSOLETE**
- Priority: 1
- Description: ~~Migrate from sqlite3 to better-sqlite3 for better Termux/ARM compatibility and performance~~
- Depends on: Current project state analysis
- Phase: Architecture Update
- Started: 2025-09-13 14:30
- Branch: TASK-011-architect
- Conflicts: TASK-008 (database implementation - updated with better-sqlite3 spec)
- Planning: TASK-011-architect-planning.md
- Completed: 2025-09-13 15:30
- Report: TASK-011-architect-report.md
- **OBSOLETE REASON**: Replaced by Google Sheets persistence architecture - no local SQLite needed

## [‚ùå] database - TASK-008 - Database Schema and Migrations **CANCELLED**
- Priority: 2
- Description: ~~Design and implement better-sqlite3 schema for progress tracking, deduplication, and error handling~~
- Depends on: TASK-011 (migration completed), TASK-001 (architecture approval), TASK-010 (project structure)  
- Phase: Phase 1 - Foundation Libraries
- **CANCELLED REASON**: Replaced by Google Sheets persistence architecture (sheets-database package)
- **REPLACEMENT**: TASK-012 - Google Sheets Database Enhancement

## [‚úì] seer - TASK-009 - Comprehensive Test Suite **COMPLETED**
- Priority: 3
- Description: Create unit, integration, and e2e tests for all libraries and CLI commands
- Depends on: Architecture approval, all library implementations
- Phase: Phase 5 - Testing & Hardening
