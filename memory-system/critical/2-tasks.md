- Report: TASK-005-dwarf-report.md

## [‚ùå] dwarf - TASK-006 - Proxy Library Development (Core Orchestrator) **OBSOLETE**
- Priority: 1
- Description: ~~Complete implementation of main orchestrator library with actual upload integration, content-based file hashing, rate limiting enforcement, retry logic, smart file routing (photos‚ÜíGoogle Photos, docs‚ÜíDrive), concurrent upload management, and resume capability~~
- Depends on: TASK-002, TASK-003, TASK-004, TASK-005
- Phase: Phase 2 - Core Features
- **OBSOLETE REASON**: After TASK-014 refactoring, all upload functionality is now 100% implemented in UploaderManager class:
  - ‚úÖ Actual uploads work (GoogleApis.uploadFile with real Google APIs)
  - ‚úÖ Content-based SHA-256 hashing implemented
  - ‚úÖ Smart file routing (photos‚ÜíPhotos, docs‚ÜíDrive)
  - ‚úÖ Deduplication via Google Sheets database
  - ‚úÖ Progress tracking and error handling
  - **Only missing**: CLI command wrappers (`scan`, `upload`)

## [‚ùå] database - TASK-012 - Google Sheets Database Enhancement **CANCELLED**
- Priority: 2  
- Description: ~~Enhance the sheets-database package with advanced features like batch operations, error handling, retry logic, and performance optimization~~
- Depends on: TASK-006 (Proxy library completed with basic sheets integration)
- Phase: Phase 2 - Core Features
- **CANCELLED REASON**: Over-engineering for personal WhatsApp backup use case. Current Google Sheets implementation is perfectly adequate for hundreds to thousands of files. Google Sheets API limits (100 req/sec) are more than sufficient. Following YAGNI principle - simple solution works well for intended use case.
- **DECISION**: Focus on delivering user-facing CLI features instead of premature optimization

## [‚úì] gnome - TASK-013 - Package Consolidation and Structure Simplification **COMPLETED & MERGED**
- Priority: 1
- Description: Consolidate 6 packages into single-package structure, remove Lerna/workspaces, create simplified build system
- Depends on: Current project analysis
- Phase: Phase 1 - IMMEDIATE CONSOLIDATION
- Started: 2025-09-13 10:30
- Worktree: TASK-013-gnome
- Branch: TASK-013-gnome
- Conflicts: None (first critical step in simplification)
- Planning: TASK-013-gnome-planning.md
- Completed: 2025-09-13 14:30
- Report: TASK-013-gnome-report.md
- **MERGED**: 2025-09-13 15:45 by architect - Successfully merged to main, all functionality verified

## [‚úÖ] dwarf - TASK-014 - Code Merging and API Simplification **COMPLETED & MERGED**
- Priority: 1
- Description: Merge Google Drive, Photos, and OAuth into single GoogleApis class, simplify token management, consolidate type definitions
- Depends on: TASK-013 (Package consolidation completed - ‚úÖ READY)
- Phase: Phase 2 - CODE SIMPLIFICATION
- Started: 2025-09-13 17:30
- Worktree: TASK-014-dwarf
- Branch: TASK-014-dwarf
- Conflicts: None (TASK-013 dependency resolved)
- Planning: TASK-014-dwarf-planning.md
- **Current Status**: 9-step simplification plan executed successfully
- **Progress**: Steps 1-9 ‚úÖ Complete
- **Completed**: 2025-09-13 19:45
- **Results**: 36% code reduction, unified GoogleApis class, actual upload functionality implemented
- **Report**: TASK-014-dwarf-report.md
- **MERGED**: 2025-09-13 by architect - Successfully merged to main, 36% code reduction verified, actual upload functionality confirmed

## [‚ùå] dwarf - TASK-015 - Complete Proxy Implementation (Finish TASK-006) **CANCELLED**
- Priority: 1
- Description: ~~Complete the 80% missing from TASK-006 - implement actual file uploads, proper error handling, integration with all components~~
- Depends on: TASK-014 (API simplification completed)
- Phase: Phase 3 - COMPLETE PROXY IMPLEMENTATION
- **CANCELLED REASON**: Task description was incorrect - upload functionality is already 100% implemented in UploaderManager class. Real uploads work with Google Drive/Photos APIs. Only missing is CLI command integration.

## [‚ùå] api - TASK-007 - CLI Application Development **CANCELLED**
- Priority: 2
- Description: ~~Implement complete CLI interface with all commands (scan, upload, setup, check, logs)~~
- Depends on: TASK-015 (Proxy library truly completed)
- Phase: Phase 4 - CLI & UX (moved up from Phase 4 due to TASK-012 cancellation)
- **CANCELLED REASON**: Over-engineered scope. CLI commands `auth`, `setup`, `check` already working. Following KISS/YAGNI: only implement missing `scan` and `upload` commands.

## [‚ùå] architect - TASK-011 - SQLite3 to better-sqlite3 Migration **OBSOLETE**
- Priority: 1
- Description: ~~Migrate from sqlite3 to better-sqlite3 for better Termux/ARM compatibility and performance~~
- Depends on: Current project state analysis
- Phase: Architecture Update

- Planning: TASK-011-architect-planning.md
- Completed: 2025-09-13 15:30
- Report: TASK-011-architect-report.md
- **OBSOLETE REASON**: Replaced by Google Sheets persistence architecture - no local SQLite needed

## [‚ùå] database - TASK-008 - Database Schema and Migrations **CANCELLED**
- Priority: 2
- Description: ~~Design and implement better-sqlite3 schema for progress tracking, deduplication, and error handling~~
- Depends on: TASK-011 (migration completed), TASK-001 (architecture approval), TASK-010 (project structure)  
- Phase: Phase 1 - Foundation Libraries
- **CANCELLED REASON**: Replaced by Google Sheets persistence architecture (sheets-database package)
- **REPLACEMENT**: TASK-012 - Google Sheets Database Enhancement

## [‚úì] seer - TASK-009 - Comprehensive Test Suite **COMPLETED**
- Priority: 3
- Description: Create unit, integration, and e2e tests for all libraries and CLI commands

  - [‚úì] Handles multiple crypt files in directory
  - [‚úì] Creates 'decrypted/' subdirectory for output

## [‚ùå] dwarf - TASK-021 - WhatsApp Database Chat Scanner Enhancement (Phase 2) **OBSOLETE**
- Priority: 2 (High - Core Feature)
- Description: ~~Enhance existing scanner to read chat information from decrypted msgstore.db~~
- Depends on: TASK-020 (Decryption working)
- Phase: Phase 2 - Chat-Aware Scanning
- **OBSOLETE REASON**: Replaced by TASK-023 which directly implements the user's requested feature - Google Sheets integration with chat metadata. TASK-021 was too narrowly focused on scanner enhancement only.
- **REPLACEMENT**: TASK-023 - Chat Metadata Google Sheets Integration

## [‚ùå] api - TASK-022 - Chat-Specific Upload Enhancement (Phase 3) **OBSOLETE**
- Priority: 3 (Medium - Enhanced Feature)
- Description: ~~Enhance upload command to support chat-specific uploads using decrypted database information~~
- Depends on: TASK-021 (Chat scanner working)
- Phase: Phase 3 - Chat-Specific Operations
- **OBSOLETE REASON**: Following YAGNI principle - user's immediate need is for Google Sheets chat data tracking, not chat-specific uploads. Can be implemented later if needed.
- **REPLACEMENT**: None - deferred as per YAGNI

## DEFERRED (YAGNI - You Aren't Gonna Need It)

The following features were identified but deferred following YAGNI principle:

### [ ] FUTURE - CLI `status` Command
- **Why deferred**: Google Sheets already provides UI for progress tracking
- **When needed**: Only if multiple concurrent uploads become common
- **Implementation**: Query progress via existing SheetsDatabase.getProgress()

### [ ] FUTURE - CLI `logs` Command
- **Why deferred**: Google Sheets audit log + console output sufficient for personal use
- **When needed**: Only if debugging becomes frequent
- **Implementation**: Query upload history via existing SheetsDatabase.getUploadedFiles()

### [ ] FUTURE - Rate Limiting Enforcement
- **Why deferred**: Google APIs have built-in rate limiting and quotas
- **When needed**: Only if hitting API limits becomes an issue
- **Implementation**: Already exists in UploaderConfig, just needs activation

### [ ] FUTURE - Concurrent Upload Management
- **Why deferred**: Sequential uploads work fine for personal WhatsApp backup use case
- **When needed**: Only for enterprise use or very large archives (>10K files)
- **Implementation**: Replace for-loop with Promise.all() with concurrency limit
