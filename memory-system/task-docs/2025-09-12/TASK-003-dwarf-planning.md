# Task Planning Document - TASK-003: Google Drive Library Development

## üìã Task Information
- **Task ID**: TASK-003
- **Date**: 2025-09-12 15:30
- **Agent**: dwarf
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours
- **Related Issue/TODO**: Implement Google Drive API integration for WhatsApp uploader

## üéØ Task Description
Implement the Google Drive API integration library for document and audio file uploads with resumable upload capabilities, metadata handling, and comprehensive error recovery. This library will integrate with the existing OAuth TokenManager for authentication and must pass all 569 test assertions in the comprehensive test suite.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis
- **Symptom**: No Google Drive functionality exists for file uploads
- **Root Cause**: Core Google Drive library not implemented yet
- **Proper Fix**: Implement complete DriveManager with all required methods following specification

## üìä Current State Analysis

### What Currently Exists
- OAuth TokenManager is fully implemented and tested (TASK-002 completed)
- Project structure is set up with google-drive package skeleton
- Comprehensive test suite exists with 569 test assertions
- TypeScript interfaces defined in specification
- Basic DriveManager skeleton exists at packages/google-drive/src/drive-manager.ts

### Dependencies
- ‚úÖ OAuth TokenManager from @whatsapp-uploader/oauth (completed)
- ‚úÖ Project structure setup (TASK-010 completed)
- ‚úÖ Architecture approval (TASK-001 completed)
- googleapis npm package (needs to be added)

## üèóÔ∏è Detailed Plan

### Step 1: Branch Setup and Test Analysis
**Objective**: Create branch and understand test requirements
**Actions**:
1. Create TASK-003-dwarf branch
2. Read and analyze test file to understand expected behavior
3. Run tests to see current failures
**Files to Examine**:
- `tests/unit/google-drive/drive-manager.test.ts` - Understand test requirements
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

### Step 2: Core Structure Implementation
**Objective**: Implement basic types and API client
**Actions**:
1. Implement drive-types.ts with all required interfaces
2. Implement api-client.ts with OAuth integration
3. Update drive-manager.ts with proper initialization
**Files to Modify/Create**:
- `packages/google-drive/src/types/drive-types.ts` - Complete type definitions
- `packages/google-drive/src/api-client.ts` - Google Drive API wrapper with auth
- `packages/google-drive/src/drive-manager.ts` - Update with proper constructor and init
**Estimated Time**: 90 minutes

### Step 3: File Upload Implementation
**Objective**: Implement upload functionality for small files
**Actions**:
1. Implement metadata-builder.ts for Drive metadata construction
2. Implement upload-handler.ts with basic upload support
3. Add simple upload method to DriveManager
**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `packages/google-drive/src/metadata-builder.ts` - Drive metadata construction
- `packages/google-drive/src/upload-handler.ts` - File upload logic
- `packages/google-drive/src/drive-manager.ts` - Add uploadFile method
**Estimated Time**: 120 minutes

### Step 4: Folder Management
**Objective**: Implement folder creation and organization
**Actions**:
1. Implement folder-manager.ts with folder operations
2. Add folder creation methods to DriveManager
3. Implement file existence checking
**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `packages/google-drive/src/folder-manager.ts` - Folder operations
- `packages/google-drive/src/drive-manager.ts` - Add folder methods
**Estimated Time**: 60 minutes

### Step 5: Advanced Features
**Objective**: Implement resumable uploads and error handling
**Actions**:
1. Add resumable upload support for large files
2. Implement comprehensive error handling and retry logic
3. Add storage usage reporting
**Files to Modify**:
- `packages/google-drive/src/upload-handler.ts` - Add resumable upload protocol
- `packages/google-drive/src/api-client.ts` - Enhanced error handling
- `packages/google-drive/src/drive-manager.ts` - Add getUsage method
**Estimated Time**: 120 minutes

### Step 6: Testing & Validation
**Objective**: Ensure all tests pass and performance meets requirements
**Tests to Run**:
- [ ] All 569 test assertions in drive-manager.test.ts
- [ ] Property-based tests with fast-check
- [ ] Error handling scenarios
- [ ] Resumable upload tests
**Validation Criteria**:
- [ ] All tests pass without modification
- [ ] TypeScript compilation without errors
- [ ] Memory usage <256MB for large files
- [ ] OAuth integration working properly

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria
- [ ] All 569 test assertions pass
- [ ] DriveManager class fully implemented with all required methods
- [ ] Resumable upload support for files ‚â•5MB
- [ ] Simple upload for files <5MB
- [ ] OAuth TokenManager integration working
- [ ] Folder creation and organization working
- [ ] File existence checking working
- [ ] Storage quota reporting working
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling with retry logic
- [ ] Stream-based processing (no temporary files)
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] Memory usage <256MB for any file size

## üé® Design Decisions

### Decision 1: OAuth Integration Pattern
**Options Considered**: Direct googleapis auth vs TokenManager wrapper
**Chosen**: TokenManager wrapper
**Rationale**: Maintains consistency with existing architecture and provides secure token handling

### Decision 2: Upload Strategy
**Options Considered**: Always resumable vs size-based threshold
**Chosen**: Size-based threshold (5MB)
**Rationale**: Simple uploads are more efficient for small files, resumable needed for large files

### Decision 3: Error Classification
**Options Considered**: Simple retry vs categorized error handling
**Chosen**: Categorized error handling (permanent, transient, network, quota)
**Rationale**: Provides better user experience and prevents unnecessary retries

## üîÑ Rollback Plan
If something goes wrong:
1. Revert to current state with git reset --hard
2. Switch back to previous branch
3. Tests should still pass in original state

## üìù Notes
- The comprehensive test suite provides complete specification - implement to make tests pass
- OAuth TokenManager is already tested and working - use its getValidToken() method
- Follow established patterns from OAuth library for consistency
- Use Node.js streams throughout to maintain zero-copy architecture
- Implement robust error handling as this handles user's important files
