## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented the Google Photos API integration library with comprehensive two-phase upload process, album management, and batch processing capabilities. The library provides production-ready functionality for photo and video uploads with OAuth integration, retry logic, and memory-efficient stream processing.

## Accomplishments

### ✅ Core Implementation Delivered

1. **PhotosManager Main Class** (`packages/google-photos/src/photos-manager.ts`)
   - Complete coordinator for Google Photos API integration
   - Constructor with configuration validation and Google Photos client setup
   - OAuth TokenManager integration (depends on TASK-002)
   - Stream-based processing for zero-copy architecture

2. **Two-Phase Upload Process** - Key differentiator from Drive API
   - **Phase 1**: `uploadBytes()` - Upload file bytes to get upload token
   - **Phase 2**: `createMediaItem()` - Create media item using upload token
   - Proper error handling distinction between API errors (thrown) and business logic errors (returned)
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures

3. **Album Management** - Complete CRUD operations
   - `createAlbum()` - Album creation with name validation and sanitization
   - `listAlbums()` - List all albums with standardized format conversion
   - `findAlbums()` - Pattern-based album searching with regex support
   - `getAlbumDetails()` - Detailed album information retrieval

4. **Batch Processing** - Efficient bulk operations
   - `batchUpload()` - Upload multiple items with progress tracking
   - `addToAlbum()` - Add media items to albums with batch size handling
   - Automatic batch splitting for >50 item limits (Google Photos constraint)
   - Progress callbacks for UI integration with percentage and item counts

5. **Comprehensive Type System** (`packages/google-photos/src/types/photos-types.ts`)
   - Complete TypeScript interfaces for all operations
   - Google Photos API response structures
   - Error classification enums and types
   - Configuration and metadata interfaces

### ✅ Advanced Features Implemented

1. **Error Handling & Recovery**
   - Error classification: Permanent, Transient, Network, Quota, Invalid Media
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, max 30s)
   - Distinction between API errors (thrown) and upload failures (returned)
   - Graceful partial failure handling in batch operations

2. **Security & Validation**
   - Album name validation (empty check, 500 char limit)
   - Input sanitization (HTML/script tag removal)
   - Parameter validation for all public methods
   - Cross-platform secure file handling

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Stream-based processing for memory efficiency (<256MB target)
   - Connection pooling through googleapis client
   - Batch size optimization (50-item Google Photos limit)
   - Progress tracking without memory overhead

4. **Integration Architecture**
   - Clean separation from Drive API implementation
   - OAuth TokenManager integration from TASK-002
   - Consistent error patterns across all operations
   - Modular design for easy testing and maintenance

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Integration Architecture
```typescript
// Two-phase upload process implementation
async uploadMedia(stream: Readable, metadata: MediaMetadata): Promise<UploadResult> {
  // Phase 1: Upload bytes (API errors thrown)
  const uploadToken = await this.uploadBytes(stream);
  
  // Phase 2: Create media item (business logic errors returned)
  const mediaItem = await this.createMediaItem(uploadToken, metadata);
}
```

### Batch Processing System
```typescript
// Handles >50 item limits automatically
async batchUpload(mediaItems: MediaItem[], options?: BatchOptions): Promise<BatchResult> {
  // Phase 1: Upload all bytes in parallel
  // Phase 2: Create media items in 50-item batches
  // Progress tracking throughout both phases
}
```

### Error Classification System
```typescript
enum PhotosErrorType {
  PERMANENT = 'permanent',        // 400, 401, 403 - no retry
  TRANSIENT = 'transient',        // 429, ≥500 - retry with backoff
  NETWORK = 'network',            // Connection errors - retry
  QUOTA = 'quota',               // Storage quota exceeded - no retry
  INVALID_MEDIA = 'invalid_media' // Unsupported format - no retry
}
```

## Google Photos API Specifics Implemented

### Key Constraints Handled
- **Upload Token Expiry**: 1-hour expiration with single-use tokens
- **Batch Size Limits**: Max 50 items per batch operation
- **Album Capacity**: Max 20,000 items per album (validation added)
- **Rate Limits**: Proper quota handling with exponential backoff
- **Media Format Validation**: JPEG, PNG, HEIC, WebP, GIF, MP4, MOV, AVI, WMV, FLV, ogg

### Unique Differences from Drive API
1. **Two-phase upload** vs single-phase for Drive
2. **Albums** vs folders (different concepts and limits)
3. **Native batch support** vs sequential processing
4. **Stricter media validation** requirements
5. **Different rate limit structures**
