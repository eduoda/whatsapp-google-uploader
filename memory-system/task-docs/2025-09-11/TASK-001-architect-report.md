## Key Architectural Decisions

### ADR-001: Modular Library Architecture
**Decision:** Five specialized libraries with clear separation of concerns
**Rationale:** Enables independent development, testing, and maintenance
**Impact:** Clean interfaces, reusable components, testable modules

### ADR-002: Zero-Copy Stream-Based Architecture  
**Decision:** Direct streaming from WhatsApp directories to Google APIs
**Rationale:** Eliminates disk space overhead and improves performance
**Impact:** Memory-efficient processing, faster uploads, no temporary storage

### ADR-003: SQLite for Progress and Deduplication
**Decision:** Embedded SQLite database for all persistence needs
**Rationale:** Zero-configuration, ACID compliance, cross-platform compatibility
**Impact:** Reliable progress tracking, efficient deduplication, simple deployment

### ADR-004: Proxy Library as Orchestrator
**Decision:** Centralized proxy library manages all cross-cutting concerns
**Rationale:** Unified rate limiting, consistent error handling, shared deduplication
**Impact:** Simplified API management, centralized reliability features

## Technical Highlights

### System Architecture
- **Pattern:** Modular library architecture with layered design
- **Communication:** Function calls between libraries, HTTPS/REST to Google APIs
- **Scalability:** Stream-based processing, configurable concurrency
- **Reliability:** Progress persistence, comprehensive recovery, exponential backoff

### Library Structure
1. **OAuth Library:** Google authentication and token management
2. **Google Drive Library:** Document/audio uploads with resumable transfers
3. **Google Photos Library:** Photo/video uploads with album management
4. **WhatsApp Scanner:** Cross-platform file discovery and metadata extraction
5. **Proxy Library:** Upload orchestration with rate limiting and deduplication

### Data Architecture
- **SQLite Schema:** Progress tracking, file deduplication, error logging
- **File Metadata Standard:** Unified interface for all file operations
- **Progress State Management:** Session recovery and resumable uploads
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Windows, macOS, Linux, Android/Termux

## Performance Requirements Met

### Memory Efficiency
- Constant memory usage regardless of file size
- Stream-based processing for large video files
- No temporary file storage requirements

### Processing Capability  
- Target: 10,000+ files per chat
- Configurable batch processing (default: 10 files)
- Concurrent uploads with rate limiting
- SHA-256 deduplication across sessions

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error classification and recovery
- Exponential backoff for API rate limits
- Graceful handling of interruptions (Ctrl+C, network loss, system crash)
- 100% resumable uploads with progress persistence

## Next Steps Required

### Phase 1: User Approval (CRITICAL)
- **Status:** REQUIRED BEFORE PROCEEDING
- **Action:** Present architecture to user for approval
- **Deliverable:** User sign-off on architecture document

### Phase 2: Test Definition (After Approval)
- **Agent:** seer
- **Action:** Create comprehensive test suite specifications
- **Output:** TEST-SUITE.md with unit, integration, and e2e tests

### Phase 3: Library Interface Completion
- **Action:** Complete library interface contracts in api-contracts.md
- **Content:** Method signatures, data contracts, error specifications

### Phase 4: Phased Implementation
- **Sequence:** Foundation Libraries → Core Features → Advanced Features → CLI & UX → Testing
- **Duration:** 8 weeks total
- **Quality Gates:** 100% test pass rate, no workarounds, complete documentation
