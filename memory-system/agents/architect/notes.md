## Session Notes

### 2025-09-11 - Architecture Design Session
**Project**: WhatsApp Google Uploader - Production-ready Node.js CLI application

**Key Architectural Insights**:
- **Zero-copy streaming is critical**: Traditional architectures copy files to temp storage, but with potentially 10GB+ WhatsApp archives, this wastes disk space and reduces performance
- **Modular library approach provides clean separation**: 5 libraries (OAuth, Drive, Photos, Proxy, Scanner) with clear responsibilities
- **Proxy library is the orchestrator**: Centralizes rate limiting, deduplication, error handling, and recovery across all upload services
- **SQLite perfect for persistence**: Zero-configuration, ACID compliance, handles progress tracking and SHA-256 deduplication database
- **Cross-platform complexity**: Android/Termux has different paths and permissions than desktop platforms

**Technical Decisions Made**:
- Stream-based uploads with Node.js native streams (memory-efficient for large video files)
- SHA-256 hashing for deduplication (prevents duplicate uploads across sessions)
- SQLite schema for progress state, file hashes, error tracking, configuration
- Commander.js for comprehensive CLI with scan/upload/setup/check/logs commands
- Exponential backoff for Google API rate limiting (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 30s max)

**Implementation Phases Defined**:
1. **Foundation Libraries** (Weeks 1-2): OAuth, basic Drive/Photos APIs, database schema
2. **Core Features** (Weeks 3-4): Scanner, Proxy orchestration, deduplication, progress tracking
3. **Advanced Features** (Weeks 5-6): Rate limiting, batch processing, comprehensive error handling
4. **CLI & UX** (Week 7): Complete CLI interface with all commands
5. **Testing & Hardening** (Week 8): Full test suite, security audit, documentation

**Next Required Actions**:
- **USER APPROVAL REQUIRED**: Must get architecture approval before proceeding to Phase 2 (Test Definition)
- Complete library interface contracts in api-contracts.md
- Create task specifications for each agent (dwarf for libraries, seer for testing)
- Prepare consolidated development plan for user review

**Considerations for Next Session**:
- Google API quotas and limits need investigation (Photos API has different limits than Drive API)
- Android/Termux file permission handling requires special attention
- Recovery system must handle all interruption scenarios (Ctrl+C, network loss, API errors, system crash)
- Performance benchmarks needed (target: process 1000 files without memory growth)

### 2025-09-12 - TASK-004 Google Photos Library Orchestration

**Project**: WhatsApp Google Uploader - Google Photos Library Development

**Key Architectural Insights from Analysis**:
- **Two-phase upload complexity**: Google Photos requires bytes upload ‚Üí upload token ‚Üí media item creation (vs Drive's single-phase)
- **Batch processing critical**: Native batch support with 50-item limit significantly different from Drive's sequential approach
- **Album vs folder paradigm**: Albums have 20,000 item limits and different organization model than Drive folders
- **Rate limit differences**: Photos API has distinct quota structures requiring separate rate limiting strategy
- **Media validation strictness**: Photos API has more restrictive format validation than Drive

**Technical Decisions Made**:
- **Comprehensive test suite analysis**: 744+ test assertions provide complete functional specification
- **OAuth TokenManager integration**: Reuse existing secure authentication from TASK-002
- **Stream-based processing**: Maintain zero-copy architecture for memory efficiency
- **Error classification refinement**: Photos-specific error types (INVALID_MEDIA) beyond Drive patterns
- **Progress tracking enhancement**: Multi-phase progress reporting for upload token + media item creation

**Implementation Strategy Defined**:
1. **Phase 1**: Core infrastructure with OAuth integration and album management
2. **Phase 2**: Two-phase media upload with token management
3. **Phase 3**: Batch processing with 50-item limits and progress tracking
4. **Phase 4**: Test suite completion and performance optimization

**Critical Implementation Considerations**:
- **Upload token lifecycle**: 1-hour expiration, single-use tokens require careful management
- **Batch size enforcement**: Never exceed 50 items per API call to avoid errors
- **Album capacity monitoring**: Handle 20,000 item limit proactively
- **Error recovery distinction**: Different retry strategies for upload vs media item creation failures
- **Memory efficiency**: Stream processing must maintain constant memory usage regardless of batch size

**Quality Standards Established**:
- All 744+ test assertions must pass (comprehensive functional coverage)
- TypeScript strict mode compliance with full type safety
- <256MB memory usage regardless of file size or batch size
- Progress reporting accuracy across multi-phase operations
- Security validation for all user inputs (album names, descriptions)

**Integration Patterns Defined**:

### 2025-09-13 - TASK-006 Correction: Proxy Library Status

**Critical Issue Identified**: TASK-006 was incorrectly marked as COMPLETED when only ~20% implemented.

**Current Implementation Analysis**:
- ‚úÖ **Complete**: Google Sheets integration, progress tracking structure, deduplication checking, upload workflow skeleton
- ‚ùå **Missing**: Core functionality including actual uploads, content hashing, rate limiting, retry logic, smart routing, concurrency, resume capability

**Root Cause**: Confusion between "structure implemented" vs "functionality implemented"
- Google Sheets integration working correctly
- Upload loop structure exists but contains placeholder TODOs
- File hashing broken (hashes path instead of content)
- No rate limiting enforcement despite config existing

**Corrective Actions Taken**:
1. **Status Update**: TASK-006 reopened with accurate 20% completion assessment
2. **Requirements Clarification**: Added detailed missing implementation list and acceptance criteria
3. **Quality Gate**: Defined what "truly complete" means for the proxy orchestrator
4. **Dependency Impact**: TASK-007 (CLI) correctly blocked until real upload functionality exists

**Technical Debt Identified**:
- Line 74: `TODO: Actual upload logic here` - Core missing functionality
- Line 135: `calculateHash(filePath)` - Hashes path not content (broken design)
- Rate limiting config unused throughout codebase
- No integration with completed Google Drive/Photos libraries

**Implementation Priority**: Critical Path
- TASK-006 blocks CLI development
- Without real uploads, entire application non-functional
- Must integrate with existing TASK-002/003/004 completed libraries

**Learning**: Always validate actual functionality vs structural implementation before marking tasks complete
