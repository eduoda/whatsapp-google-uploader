# Session Log - All Agent Activities

<!-- Example format:
## Session: 2025-08-22 18:00
**Agent**: agent-name
**Task**: Consolidate archiving documentation following hybrid strategy

### Actions Taken (MANDATORY SECTION)
- Moved archiving instructions from archive-tasks.md to README.md
- Added archive reference to CLAUDE.md
- Deleted redundant archive-tasks.md file
- Maintained hybrid strategy: critical info in CLAUDE.md, details in README

### Files Modified (MANDATORY SECTION)
- `.claude/memory/README.md` - Added complete archiving process section
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added archive file location and note
- `.claude/memory/shared/archive-tasks.md` - DELETED (content moved to README)

### Rationale (MANDATORY SECTION)
- Following hybrid strategy established earlier
- CLAUDE.md: Points to archive location (critical info)
- README.md: Contains detailed archiving process (complete documentation)
- Eliminated redundancy by removing standalone instructions file

### Key Benefits Achieved
1. **100% Read Guarantee** - Critical rules in CLAUDE.md (always read)
2. **No Duplication** - Single source of truth for each component
3. **Clear Hierarchy** - CLAUDE.md has mandates, README has details
4. **Better Organization** - Separation of critical vs supplementary

### Documentation Structure
- **CLAUDE.md**: Mandatory workflow, formats, rules (~135 lines added)
- **README.md**: Implementation details, templates, guides (reduced by ~120 lines)
- **Cross-references**: Both files point to each other appropriately

## 2025-09-11 - Architect Session - Architecture Design

### Actions Completed
- **Read PROJECT-SPECS.md**: Analyzed comprehensive requirements for WhatsApp Google Uploader
- **Created ARCHITECTURE.md**: Comprehensive system architecture with C4 diagrams, ADRs, and implementation guidelines  
- **Updated memory-system/critical/1-project-context.md**: Set project context for WhatsApp Google Uploader
- **Started updating memory-system/reference/tech-stack.md**: Technology stack for Node.js CLI application
- **Updated memory-system/critical/2-tasks.md**: Added TASK-001 for architecture design
- **Started updating memory-system/reference/architecture.md**: System architecture reference

### Architecture Decisions Made
- **ADR-001**: Modular Library Architecture (5 libraries: OAuth, Drive, Photos, Proxy, Scanner)
- **ADR-002**: Zero-Copy Stream-Based Architecture for direct file processing
- **ADR-003**: SQLite for progress tracking and SHA-256 deduplication
- **ADR-004**: Proxy Library as unified API manager and orchestrator

### Key Design Choices  
- **Zero-copy direct streaming**: No temporary files, memory-efficient processing
- **Cross-platform support**: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android/Termux
- **Enterprise reliability**: Recovery, deduplication, rate limiting, comprehensive error handling
- **CLI-first interface**: commander.js with comprehensive command suite

### Next Steps Required
- **User approval**: Architecture must be approved before Phase 2 (Test Definition)
- **Library interface contracts**: Complete API contracts documentation
- **Task specifications**: Create detailed specs for each library development
- **Development phases**: Begin Phase 1 implementation after approval

### Files Created/Modified
- `/home/oda/whatsapp/whatsapp-google-uploader/ARCHITECTURE.md` (created)
- Memory system files updated with project-specific context
