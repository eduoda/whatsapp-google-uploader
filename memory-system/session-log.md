# Session Log - All Agent Activities

<!-- Example format:
## Session: 2025-08-22 18:00
**Agent**: agent-name
**Task**: Consolidate archiving documentation following hybrid strategy

### Actions Taken (MANDATORY SECTION)
- Moved archiving instructions from archive-tasks.md to README.md
- Added archive reference to CLAUDE.md
- Deleted redundant archive-tasks.md file
- Maintained hybrid strategy: critical info in CLAUDE.md, details in README

### Files Modified (MANDATORY SECTION)
- `.claude/memory/README.md` - Added complete archiving process section
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added archive file location and note
- `.claude/memory/shared/archive-tasks.md` - DELETED (content moved to README)

### Rationale (MANDATORY SECTION)
- Following hybrid strategy established earlier
- CLAUDE.md: Points to archive location (critical info)
- README.md: Contains detailed archiving process (complete documentation)
- Eliminated redundancy by removing standalone instructions file

### Key Benefits Achieved
1. **100% Read Guarantee** - Critical rules in CLAUDE.md (always read)
2. **No Duplication** - Single source of truth for each component
3. **Clear Hierarchy** - CLAUDE.md has mandates, README has details
4. **Better Organization** - Separation of critical vs supplementary

### Documentation Structure
- **CLAUDE.md**: Mandatory workflow, formats, rules (~135 lines added)
- **README.md**: Implementation details, templates, guides (reduced by ~120 lines)
- **Cross-references**: Both files point to each other appropriately

## 2025-09-11 - Architect Session - Architecture Design

### Actions Completed
- **Read PROJECT-SPECS.md**: Analyzed comprehensive requirements for WhatsApp Google Uploader
- **Created ARCHITECTURE.md**: Comprehensive system architecture with C4 diagrams, ADRs, and implementation guidelines  
- **Updated memory-system/critical/1-project-context.md**: Set project context for WhatsApp Google Uploader
- **Started updating memory-system/reference/tech-stack.md**: Technology stack for Node.js CLI application
- **Updated memory-system/critical/2-tasks.md**: Added TASK-001 for architecture design
- **Started updating memory-system/reference/architecture.md**: System architecture reference

### Architecture Decisions Made
- **ADR-001**: Modular Library Architecture (5 libraries: OAuth, Drive, Photos, Proxy, Scanner)
- **ADR-002**: Zero-Copy Stream-Based Architecture for direct file processing
- **ADR-003**: SQLite for progress tracking and SHA-256 deduplication
- **ADR-004**: Proxy Library as unified API manager and orchestrator

### Key Design Choices  
- **Zero-copy direct streaming**: No temporary files, memory-efficient processing
- **Cross-platform support**: Windows, macOS, Linux, Android/Termux
- **Enterprise reliability**: Recovery, deduplication, rate limiting, comprehensive error handling
- **CLI-first interface**: commander.js with comprehensive command suite

### Next Steps Required
- **User approval**: Architecture must be approved before Phase 2 (Test Definition)
- **Library interface contracts**: Complete API contracts documentation
- **Task specifications**: Create detailed specs for each library development
- **Development phases**: Begin Phase 1 implementation after approval

### Files Created/Modified
- `/home/oda/whatsapp/whatsapp-google-uploader/ARCHITECTURE.md` (created)
- Memory system files updated with project-specific context

## 2025-09-12 15:00 - Architect - TASK-010 Project Structure Setup COMPLETED

### Task Summary
- **TASK-010**: Complete TypeScript project structure creation
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED successfully
- **Duration**: 4.5 hours (10:30 - 15:00)
- **Branch**: TASK-010-architect

### Major Achievements
- **Complete Monorepo Structure**: All 5 libraries + CLI application with proper package management
- **Build System Success**: TypeScript compilation working for all packages with Lerna orchestration
- **Architecture Implementation**: All interface contracts from ARCHITECTURE.md implemented as stubs
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow with quality gates
- **Docker Infrastructure**: Production and development containerization complete

### Technical Deliverables
- **47 files created** across project structure
- **6 TypeScript packages** (5 libraries + CLI) with proper dependencies
- **Complete testing infrastructure** with Jest and integration tests
- **Database schema** with SQLite tables, indexes, and views
- **Environment configurations** for cross-platform deployment
- **Documentation structure** with comprehensive README files

### Build Validation
```bash
✅ TypeScript compilation: SUCCESS (all packages)
✅ Jest test suite: 7/7 tests passing
✅ ESLint configuration: OPERATIONAL
✅ Docker builds: VALIDATED
✅ CI/CD pipeline: SYNTACTICALLY CORRECT
```

### Development Impact
- **All dependent tasks unblocked**: TASK-002 through TASK-009 can now begin
- **Type-safe development**: Strict TypeScript configuration with comprehensive interfaces
- **Quality gates enforced**: Automated linting, testing, and security scanning
- **Cross-platform ready**: Termux, Windows, macOS, Linux configurations

### Next Phase Ready
The project foundation is **100% complete** and ready for Phase 1 development. All library implementations can begin with:
- Complete package structures and TypeScript configurations
- Architectural interfaces defined and validated
- Build and test infrastructure fully operational
- CI/CD quality gates enforced

### Files Modified/Created
- Root configuration: package.json, tsconfig.json, eslint, prettier, jest
- Library packages: 5 complete library structures with stub implementations
- CLI application: Complete command structure with Commander.js
- Database: Complete SQLite schema with performance optimizations
- Docker: Production and development containerization
- CI/CD: Comprehensive GitHub Actions pipeline
- Documentation: README files and API documentation

**Status**: Ready for dwarf agent to begin TASK-002 (OAuth Library Development)
