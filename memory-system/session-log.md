# Session Log - All Agent Activities

<!-- Example format:
## Session: 2025-08-22 18:00
**Agent**: agent-name
**Task**: Consolidate archiving documentation following hybrid strategy

### Actions Taken (MANDATORY SECTION)
- Moved archiving instructions from archive-tasks.md to README.md
- Added archive reference to CLAUDE.md
- Deleted redundant archive-tasks.md file
- Maintained hybrid strategy: critical info in CLAUDE.md, details in README

### Files Modified (MANDATORY SECTION)
- `.claude/memory/README.md` - Added complete archiving process section
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added archive file location and note
- `.claude/memory/shared/archive-tasks.md` - DELETED (content moved to README)

### Rationale (MANDATORY SECTION)
- Following hybrid strategy established earlier
- CLAUDE.md: Points to archive location (critical info)
- README.md: Contains detailed archiving process (complete documentation)
- Eliminated redundancy by removing standalone instructions file

### Key Benefits Achieved
1. **100% Read Guarantee** - Critical rules in CLAUDE.md (always read)
2. **No Duplication** - Single source of truth for each component
3. **Clear Hierarchy** - CLAUDE.md has mandates, README has details
4. **Better Organization** - Separation of critical vs supplementary

### Documentation Structure
- **CLAUDE.md**: Mandatory workflow, formats, rules (~135 lines added)
- **README.md**: Implementation details, templates, guides (reduced by ~120 lines)
- **Cross-references**: Both files point to each other appropriately
