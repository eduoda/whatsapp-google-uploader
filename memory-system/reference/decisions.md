## Active Decisions

### ADR-001: Microservices Architecture
**Date:** 2025-01-15  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Architect, Tech Lead  
**Related:** ADR-002, ADR-003  

#### Context
The application needs to scale different components independently and be developed by multiple teams working in parallel.

#### Decision
Adopt a microservices architecture with service boundaries aligned to business domains (DDD bounded contexts).

#### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Independent scaling of services
- Team autonomy and parallel development
- Technology diversity where beneficial
- Fault isolation

**Negative:**
- Increased operational complexity
- Network latency between services
- Data consistency challenges
- Need for service discovery and orchestration

#### Alternatives Considered
1. **Monolithic Architecture:** Rejected due to scaling limitations and team coupling
2. **Serverless Functions:** Too granular for our use case, vendor lock-in concerns

---

### ADR-002: API Gateway Pattern
**Date:** 2025-01-15  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Architect, DevOps Lead  
**Related:** ADR-001  

#### Context
With multiple microservices, clients need a unified entry point and we need centralized cross-cutting concerns.

#### Decision
Implement an API Gateway using [Kong/AWS API Gateway/Custom solution] for request routing, authentication, and rate limiting.

#### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Single entry point for clients
- Centralized authentication and authorization
- Request/response transformation capabilities
- Built-in rate limiting and throttling

**Negative:**
- Single point of failure (mitigated with HA setup)
- Additional network hop
- Potential bottleneck if not properly scaled

#### Alternatives Considered
1. **Direct Service Access:** Security concerns and client complexity
2. **Service Mesh:** Overkill for current scale, steep learning curve

---

### ADR-003: Event-Driven Communication
**Date:** 2025-01-16  
**Status:** Proposed  
**Deciders:** Architect, Backend Team  
**Related:** ADR-001  

#### Context
Services need to communicate asynchronously for certain operations to avoid tight coupling and improve resilience.

#### Decision
Use event-driven architecture with [RabbitMQ/Kafka/AWS EventBridge] for inter-service communication where synchronous calls are not required.

#### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Loose coupling between services
- Better fault tolerance
- Natural audit log of events
- Enables event sourcing if needed

**Negative:**
- Eventual consistency complexity
- Debugging distributed flows is harder
- Need for idempotency handling
- Message ordering challenges

#### Alternatives Considered
1. **Synchronous REST Only:** Would create tight coupling and cascade failures
2. **gRPC for Everything:** Still synchronous, doesn't solve decoupling

## Technology Choices

### ADR-004: Primary Programming Language
**Date:** 2025-01-14  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Architect, Dev Team  

#### Context
Need to choose a primary language that balances developer productivity, performance, and ecosystem.

#### Decision
Use [TypeScript/Python/Go/Java] as the primary language for backend services.

#### Consequences
**Positive:**
- [Language-specific benefits]
- Strong ecosystem and libraries
- Team has existing expertise

**Negative:**
- [Language-specific drawbacks]

---

### ADR-005: Database Strategy
**Date:** 2025-01-14  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Architect, Database Admin  

#### Context
Need to decide on database strategy that supports our scalability and consistency requirements.

#### Decision
Use PostgreSQL for transactional data and Redis for caching and session storage.

#### Consequences
**Positive:**
- ACID compliance for critical data
- Rich query capabilities
- Proven scalability patterns

**Negative:**
- Vertical scaling limitations
- Need for read replicas at scale

---

## Frontend Decisions

### ADR-006: Frontend Framework
**Date:** 2025-01-13  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Architect, Frontend Team  

#### Context
Need a modern frontend framework that supports our UX requirements and team skills.

#### Decision
Use [React/Vue/Angular/Svelte] with TypeScript for type safety.

#### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Component reusability
- Strong ecosystem
- Type safety with TypeScript

**Negative:**
- Bundle size considerations
- Learning curve for new developers

---

## Security Decisions

### ADR-007: Authentication Strategy
**Date:** 2025-01-12  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Architect, Security Team  

#### Context
Need secure, scalable authentication that supports multiple client types.

#### Decision
Implement JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens, using [Auth0/Cognito/Custom].

#### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Stateless authentication
- Works across different client types
- Standard-based approach

**Negative:**
- Token size overhead
- Revocation complexity
- Need secure token storage on clients
